Data Quality Assessment
=======================

In the following, we will assess the data quality by looking at the sequencing effort, the raw reads and the data quality as reported by the sequencing instrument (using MinIONQC and FastQC) as well as inferring the actual data quality by aligning the reads to the reference genome (read mapping).
