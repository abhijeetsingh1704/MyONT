The results with complete data
------------------------------

Since this dataset was only a fraction of our real data, we have precomputed the basecalling of the complete dataset (and another smaller subset) for you. It is located in the results folder, move it into your workdir::

  cp -r ~/workdir/results/basecall_small/ ~/workdir/.
  cp -r ~/workdir/results/basecall/ ~/workdir/.
