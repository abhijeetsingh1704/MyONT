Assembly polishing
==================

We are going to do 2 polishings to optimize our assembly:
1. Polishing with pilon using Illumina data
2. Polishing with racon and medaka using Nanopore data

If there is time we are also going to polish the racon/medaka polished assembly with Pilon and Illumina data.

A possible polishing with nanopolish is also included in this docs, but we are not going to use it in this course.
